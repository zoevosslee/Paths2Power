                >Paths to Power is a collaborative project funded by the African American Action Fund ‘Places of Black
                Women Activism’ grant centered on spaces of Black resistance, community-building, and joy in Civil
                Rights-era.&nbsp;&nbsp;With Paths to Power, we honor the paths and places of this enduring legacy by
                mapping the spaces that ignited radical change and collective empowerment during the Civil Rights era.
                These are the places where Black women stood tall, built communities, created joy, and fought tirelessly
                for justice—shaping the very fabric of our society.<br />
                <br />Our pilot project focuses on Brooklyn, spotlighting the often-overlooked yet powerful stories of
                Black women’s activism. Through a collaborative effort funded by the African American Action Fund’s
                Places of Black Women Activism grant, we are preserving the spaces where critical movements or events
                took place. <br /><br />Partnering with historic institutions and drawing on crowd-sourced narratives,
                we weave together places that inhabit the political memory, scholarship, and leadership of Black women
                who’ve redefined what it means to resist. From organizing hubs to cultural sanctuaries, these places
                reflect the strength, vision, and unapologetic power of Black women as agents of radical change.<br /><br /></span
